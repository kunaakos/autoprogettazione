# [Enzo Mari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzo_Mari)'s [Autoprogettazione?](https://socks-studio.com/2016/04/18/critical-understanding-through-practice-autoprogettazione-by-enzo-mari-1974/) - parametrized!

Implemented in OpenSCAD.

## Pieces

These are named as they are in the book, and accurately follow the designs - with the only modification being that you can choose your own parameters to make them out of different sizes of lumber, or to fit your own spaces.

### ... the rest?
 Will be added as I make them - but this is a hobby project, so it happens when it happens. If you'd like to contribute, do open an issue for the piece you want to make.
